Future
------

Things that still need to be implemented or changed.

### Still need to do ###
1. Add `conditions`, `procedures`, and `diagnoses`.
2. Add `cancan` support
3. Change to JQuery

### Changes ###
1. Refactor roles to User `has_one` Role, versus a `has_and_belongs_to_many` relationship.  I do not see a need for this complexity, considering that roles will inherit from each other.
2. Remove ability to edit roles.  Should be fine to leave them hard-coded
